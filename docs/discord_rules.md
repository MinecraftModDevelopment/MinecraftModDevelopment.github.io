Do not promote illegal activity:This includes piracy, cheating, or any breach of Minecraft's [EULA](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula) or similar documents.
Keep pings to a minimum:Only ping people when needed (before sending DMs for example).;nMoreover, if people ask you to turn off ping replies, make sure to do so!
Ping staff roles when needed:Pinging a staff role is more beneficial than pinging specific members, resulting in actions taken faster.
Don't ask to ask:Please just ask questions; don't test the waters for the real question. Instead, ask the full question so that others can better understand what you need, rather than creating an atmosphere of assumptions and discouraging people from wanting to help.;n[More Information](https://solhsa.com/dontask.html)

Please keep in mind that the opinions and views expressed by staff of MMD do not necessary reflect the opinions and views of MMD as a whole. Remember, we are individuals, who are not in any way obligated to help you with issues that do not involve the MMD server itself. Also, do not confuse MMD staff with the people who develop MMD mods! There is certainly some overlap, but that does not mean that a member of one knows anything about the other.

Have a nice stay here. See you around!
